# Links between tropical Pacific seasonal, interannual, and orbital variability dujring the Holocene. 

## Motivation

This series of Notebook partially reproduce the study by [Emile-Geay et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2608) entitled "Links between tropical Pacific seasonal, interannual, and orbital variability during the Holocene", published in Nature Geoscience. 

The goal is to (1) transform the Matlab data files into the [LiPD format](https://lipd.net) so they are more widely available, and (2) update the Matlab code with Python libraries such as [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Code background

The original code and data was provided by Julien Emile-Geay and is available [on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CommonClimate/EmileGeay_NatGeo2015). This repository was forked here in February 2025 and is preserved on the `original-study` branch.
